When I open any office 365 program, a "Intelligent Work" pop-up appears in the bottom right corner of the screen. I switch applications, it pops up. I minimize then open again, it pops up. I cannot find intelligent services options in any program options to turn off. Please help.

I believe this is due to the MSI Center software, especially the MSI AI Engine feature. To turn off this extremely annoying message, you can open the MSI Center, open the MSI AI Engine feature, click on the gear icon next to "AI Engine: ON" then uncheck the "Show the profile switching animation when AI Engine initiates."

Believe this just started happening due to an MSI Center software update that I received today. See my reply to the original message.

Turning AI off seems to solve that problem.
