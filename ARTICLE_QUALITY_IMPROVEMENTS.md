# Knowledge Base Article Quality Improvements

## Problem
The script was generating low-quality KB articles with generic content like:
- "Verify the basic configuration and settings"
- "Check for any recent changes or updates"
- Just listing tags as symptoms

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Dead Fallback Code**
Lines 411-460 contained unreachable generic article generation code. While it was never executed (due to exception handling), it represented a fallback approach that shouldn't exist.

### 2. **Overly Aggressive Text Sanitization**
The `sanitize_text()` function was removing ALL capitalized words, treating them as personal names. This destroyed:
- Technical terms (Windows, Outlook, OneDrive, CtfMon, etc.)
- Service names
- Error messages
- Commands and file paths
- Any technical content that could help the AI

### 3. **Insufficient Quality Checks**
No validation that the AI-generated content was actually useful.

### 4. **Limited Token Budget**
Only 4000 max_tokens, which limited article detail and length.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Removed Fallback Code and Added Quality Checks
- **Removed:** Lines 411-460 (generic fallback article template)
- **Added:** Length validation (minimum 500 characters)
- **Added:** Content quality check to detect generic placeholder text
- **Added:** Better error messages explaining why generation failed
- **Result:** Script now **aborts completely** if AI generation fails or produces poor quality content

### 2. Improved Text Sanitization (Smart PII Removal)
Created an intelligent sanitization system that:

**Preserves Technical Content:**
- Technical terms whitelist (Windows, Microsoft, Office, Outlook, Exchange, Teams, Google, Gmail, etc.)
- File extensions (.exe, .dll, .sys, .log, .txt, .bat, .ps1, .msc)
- File paths (containing \ or /)
- Acronyms (all caps words like DNS, API, HTTP)
- Error codes (0x prefixes, ERR/HR prefixes)
- Common technical URLs (microsoft.com, google.com, github.com, stackoverflow.com)

**Still Removes PII:**
- Email addresses → `[EMAIL_REDACTED]`
- Phone numbers → `[PHONE_REDACTED]`
- Person names (detected via FirstName LastName pattern) → `[NAME_REDACTED]`
- Private URLs → `[URL_REDACTED]`

**Result:** AI now receives useful technical context instead of `[NAME REDACTED]` everywhere.

### 3. Enhanced Data Collection and Analysis
- **Added:** Ticket subjects to context (users' original issue descriptions)
- **Improved:** Solution comment filtering (ignore very short comments < 20 chars)
- **Added:** Data quality diagnostics before AI generation:
  - Number of subjects, issues, solutions collected
  - Total content length
  - Warnings if data is insufficient
- **Result:** Better understanding of data quality before attempting generation

### 4. Improved AI Prompting
**Enhanced System Prompt:**
- Explicitly instructs AI to be "highly detailed with specific technical steps"
- Requests commands, registry paths, service names, error codes
- Asks for `<kbd>` and `<code>` HTML tags for better formatting
- Warns against generic placeholder content
- Allows AI to infer solutions from technical domain knowledge if ticket data lacks detail

**Improved Context:**
- Structured data presentation (Subjects, Issues, Solutions/Resolution Steps)
- Longer excerpts (300 chars for issues, 400 for solutions)
- More solution comments included (20 instead of 15)

### 5. Increased Token Budget
- Changed from 4000 to **6000 max_tokens**
- Allows for longer, more detailed articles like the good example (68 lines)

### 6. Increased API Timeout
- Changed from 30s to **60s timeout**
- Gives Grok-4 reasoning model more time to think and generate quality content

## Expected Outcomes

### Before (Poor Quality Example)
```html
<h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
<ul>
<li>Issues tagged as 'managed_support' (appears in 6 tickets)</li>
<li>Issues tagged as 'qld' (appears in 5 tickets)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Resolution Steps</h2>
<ol>
<li><p>Verify the basic configuration and settings</p></li>
<li><p>Check for any recent changes or updates...</p></li>
```

### After (High Quality Example)
```html
<h2>Step-by-Step Solution: Restore Ctfmon and Windows Search Functionality</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Restart Windows Search Service</strong><br>
   Press <kbd>Windows + R</kbd>, type <code>services.msc</code>, and press Enter...
</li>
<li><strong>Enable Ctfmon Service</strong><br>
   In the same Services window, find "Touch Keyboard and Handwriting Panel Service"...
</li>
</ol>
```

## Behavior Changes

### No More Fallbacks
- **Old:** Generate generic article if API fails
- **New:** Abort completely with clear error message explaining why

### Better Diagnostics
Script now shows:
```
Data quality check:
  - Subjects: 6
  - Issue descriptions: 6
  - Solution comments: 12
  - Total content length: 2843 characters
```

Then validates output:
```
✓ Generated high-quality article (4567 characters)
```

Or aborts with:
```
✗ ERROR: Failed to generate article with Grok API: Generated article contains generic placeholder content
ABORTING: Cannot generate article without AI assistance.
Possible reasons:
  - API connection failed
  - Generated content was too generic/low quality
  - Insufficient ticket data or too much sanitization
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with various search queries** to ensure sanitization preserves technical terms
2. **Monitor data quality warnings** - if content length is consistently low, may need to adjust search queries
3. **Review generated articles** - ensure they match the quality of `kb_article_20251001_143312.html`
4. **Check error handling** - verify script properly aborts on API failures
