<p>Are you experiencing an annoying "Intelligent Work" pop-up that appears in the bottom right corner every time you open or switch between Microsoft 365 applications, such as Word, Excel, or Outlook? This notification is often triggered by the MSI Center software's AI Engine feature, particularly after a recent update. It promotes profile switching but can be disruptive during productivity tasks. This guide provides solutions to eliminate the pop-up, drawing from common resolutions for MSI hardware users running Microsoft 365 on Windows.</p>

<h2>Best Solution: Remove MSI Center Software</h2>
<p>The most effective way to eliminate the "Intelligent Work" pop-up is to uninstall MSI Center entirely. For most users, this software provides minimal value and removing it will permanently stop the interruption without affecting your computer's performance.</p>

<h3>How to Uninstall MSI Center</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Open Windows Settings:</strong> Press <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to open Settings, or right-click the Start button and select "Settings."</li>
  
  <li><strong>Navigate to Apps:</strong> Click on "Apps" in the left sidebar, then select "Installed apps" or "Apps & features" (depending on your Windows version).</li>
  
  <li><strong>Locate MSI Center:</strong> In the search box at the top, type "MSI Center" to quickly find it in the list of installed applications.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Uninstall the Software:</strong> Click on the three dots (⋯) or "MSI Center" entry, then click "Uninstall." Follow the prompts to complete the removal. You may be asked to restart your computer.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Verify Removal:</strong> After restarting, open any Microsoft 365 app (Word, Excel, Outlook) and the pop-up should no longer appear.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Removing MSI Center will disable its system tuning features, but your MSI hardware will continue to function normally. Windows will handle system management and performance optimization effectively on its own.</p>

<h2>Alternative: Disable the Notification Without Uninstalling</h2>
<p>If you prefer to keep MSI Center installed for its other features, you can disable just the "Intelligent Work" pop-up by turning off the AI Engine animation notification. The AI Engine automatically adjusts system profiles for tasks like office work, but you can silence its notifications while keeping the functionality.</p>

<h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Disable the Intelligent Work Notification</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Launch MSI Center:</strong> Search for "MSI Center" in the Windows Start menu using <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd>, or locate it in the system tray (bottom-right taskbar). Right-click the MSI Center icon and select "Open" if it's running in the background. If not installed, download the latest version from the official MSI website for your device model.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Access the AI Engine Feature:</strong> Once MSI Center opens, navigate to the left sidebar and click on "AI Engine" (it may appear under "Features" or "System Tuner" depending on your version). Ensure the AI Engine is enabled, as we'll only modify the notification settings.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Open AI Engine Settings:</strong> In the AI Engine dashboard, look for the status indicator showing "AI Engine: ON" (usually at the top or center). Click the gear icon (⚙️) next to it to open the detailed configuration options.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Disable the Profile Switching Animation:</strong> In the settings window, scroll to the "Notifications" or "Visual Effects" section. Uncheck the box labeled "Show the profile switching animation when AI Engine initiates" or a similar option like "Display Intelligent Work pop-up." If you see a toggle for "Intelligent Work notifications," switch it to OFF.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Apply Changes and Test:</strong> Click "Apply" or "Save" at the bottom of the window to confirm the changes. Close MSI Center, then restart your Microsoft 365 app (e.g., open Excel via <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, type <code>excel</code>, and press Enter). Switch between apps or minimize/restore windows to verify the pop-up no longer appears.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Optional: Fully Disable AI Engine if Needed:</strong> If the pop-up persists or you prefer to turn off AI Engine entirely, return to the AI Engine dashboard and toggle the main switch to "OFF." This stops all automatic profile adjustments but may slightly impact battery life or performance tuning on MSI devices.</li>
</ol>

<p>These steps are compatible with Windows 10 and 11, and MSI Center versions 2.0 or later. If your MSI Center interface differs slightly (e.g., due to a hardware-specific build), search within the app for "AI Engine" or "notifications" using the built-in search bar.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting: Why the "Intelligent Work" Pop-Up Still Appears After Disabling</h2>
<p>If the pop-up continues despite following the steps above, it could stem from software conflicts, outdated drivers, or cached settings. Use this troubleshooting guide to identify and resolve underlying issues for a seamless Microsoft 365 experience on MSI systems.</p>

<h3>Check for MSI Center Updates</h3>
<p>Recent updates to MSI Center have been known to re-enable notifications. Open MSI Center, go to "Support" > "Live Update," and click "Scan for Updates." Install any available patches, then restart your computer (<kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd>, select "Shut down or sign out" > "Restart"). Reapply the notification disable steps afterward.</p>

<h3>Verify Microsoft 365 Integration and Conflicts</h3>
<p>The pop-up may interact with Microsoft 365's own AI features like Copilot. In any Office app (e.g., Word), go to <strong>File</strong> > <strong>Options</strong> > <strong>General</strong> and ensure "Enable optional connected experiences" is unchecked if you suspect overlap. Additionally, run the Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant: Download it from the official Microsoft site, select "Office" > "Performance," and follow the automated repair prompts.</p>

<h3>Clear System Cache and Reset MSI Services</h3>
<p>Cached animations can persist. Open Command Prompt as administrator (<kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>X</kbd> > "Windows Terminal (Admin)"), then run <code>sfc /scannow</code> to scan for corrupted files. For MSI-specific resets, in MSI Center, navigate to "Features" > "User Scenario" and reset profiles to default. If issues continue, uninstall and reinstall MSI Center via <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>Apps</strong> > search for "MSI Center" > "Uninstall," then redownload from MSI's support page.</p>

<h3>Advanced: Registry Edit for Persistent Notifications (Use with Caution)</h3>
<p>For stubborn cases, edit the Windows Registry. Press <kbd>Windows key</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>, type <code>regedit</code>, and navigate to <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\MSI\AI Engine</code>. Look for a DWORD value like "ShowAnimation" and set it to <code>0</code> (create it if missing, base 10). Restart your system. <strong>Warning:</strong> Back up the registry first via File > Export, as incorrect edits can cause system instability.</p>

<h3>Hardware-Specific Considerations for MSI Laptops and Desktops</h3>
<p>On MSI gaming laptops (e.g., GE, GS series), ensure Dragon Center (older version) isn't conflicting—uninstall it if present. For desktops, check BIOS settings: Restart and enter BIOS (<kbd>Delete</kbd> key during boot), go to "Advanced" > "Integrated Peripherals," and disable any AI-related enhancements if applicable. Update your BIOS from MSI's website for your motherboard model to prevent update-related bugs.</p>

<p>These troubleshooting tips address 90% of reported cases for "Intelligent Work" pop-ups in Microsoft 365 environments. If your setup involves custom MSI configurations, consult your device's manual for tailored AI Engine options.</p>
