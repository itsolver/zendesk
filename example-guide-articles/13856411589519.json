  "body": "<p>\n  This guide explains how to configure Microsoft 365 to automatically send important\n  service and security alerts to an external partner, such as a Managed Service\n  Provider (MSP). This method uses a free Shared Mailbox to collect the alerts\n  and forward them, saving the cost of a dedicated user license.\n</p>\n<div class=\"how-to-section\">\n  <h2 id=\"h_01K5WW5QH22Y8RRY1SJA5RPXJ3\">Overview</h2>\n  <p>The process involves four key stages: \n      </p>\n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      Creating a free, unlicensed Shared Mailbox to act as a central collection\n      point for all alerts.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Configuring Microsoft 365's alert policies to send all notifications\n      to this new mailbox.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Setting up an automatic forwarding rule on the Shared Mailbox to send\n      copies of these alerts to your MSP's external email address.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      Ensuring your tenant's security policies permit automatic email forwarding\n      to external addresses.\n    </li>\n  </ol>\n  <p>\u00a0</p>\n  <h2 id=\"h_01K5WW5QH2V7Z14BZXHK2E6BYZ\">Prerequisites</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>Administrator access to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center.</li>\n    <li>Administrator access to the Exchange Admin Center.</li>\n    <li>\n      Administrator access to the Microsoft Defender portal (security.microsoft.com).\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K5WW5QH24PW7RC43Q1VCMQVW\">Resolution Steps</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 1: Create a Shared Mailbox</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      First, create a mailbox to receive the alerts. In the\n      <strong>Microsoft 365 admin center</strong>, go to\n      <strong>Teams &amp; groups  Shared mailboxes</strong> and click\n      <strong>Add a shared mailbox</strong>. Give it a clear name, such as\n      <em>M365 Alerts</em>, and an email address like\n      <em>m365-alerts@yourcompany.com</em>. This mailbox does not require a\n      license as long as it stays under 50 GB.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 2: Point M365 Alerts to the Shared Mailbox</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Next, configure the various M365 services to send notifications to your\n      new shared mailbox address.\n    </p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <strong>For Service Health:</strong> In the\n        <strong>Microsoft 365 admin center</strong>, go to\n        <strong>Health  Service health  Preferences</strong>. Under the\n        <strong>Email</strong> tab, add the shared mailbox address (<em>m365-alerts@yourcompany.com</em>)\n        to the recipient list.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>For Security &amp; Threat Alerts:</strong> In the\n        <strong>Microsoft Defender portal</strong>, go to\n        <strong>Email &amp; collaboration  Policies &amp; rules  Threat policies  Alert policy</strong>.\n        Edit each important policy and add the shared mailbox address to\n        the <strong>Recipients</strong> list.\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 3: Configure Forwarding to Your MSP</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      In the <strong>Exchange Admin Center (EAC)</strong>, go to\n      <strong>Recipients  Mailboxes</strong> and select the shared mailbox\n      you created. Go to the <strong>Mailbox</strong> tab and click\n      <strong>Mail flow settings</strong>. Edit the\n      <strong>Email forwarding</strong> rule, check the box to enable forwarding,\n      and enter your MSP's external support address (e.g.,\n      <em>support@mspcompany.com</em>).\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"note\">\n      <strong>Crucially, check the box for \"Keep a copy of forwarded email in this mailbox.\"</strong>\n      This ensures you have your own internal record of all alerts sent to\n      your partner.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 4: Allow Automatic External Forwarding</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      By default, Microsoft 365 blocks automatic forwarding to external domains.\n      You must enable this for the forwarding to work. In the\n      <strong>Microsoft Defender portal</strong>, go to\n      <strong>Email &amp; collaboration  Policies &amp; rules  Threat policies  Anti-spam</strong>.\n      Edit the <strong>Anti-spam outbound policy (Default)</strong>, find the\n      <strong>Automatic forwarding rules</strong> setting, and change it to\n      <strong>\"On - Forwarding is enabled\"</strong>. Save the policy.\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"note\">\n      Be aware that this is a tenant-wide setting that will allow any user\n      to set up automatic external forwarding. Review the security implications\n      for your organization before enabling it.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K5WW5QH2Y8CQSED5F253F850\">Was this helpful?</h2>\n<p>\n  If you've followed this guide, we'd love to hear about your experience.
