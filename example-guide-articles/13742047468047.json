  "body": "<p>This guide explains how to create and manage Microsoft 365 distribution groups (also known as distribution lists). These groups are used to send emails to multiple people at once using a single email address, such as info@yourcompany.com or accounts@yourcompany.com.</p><div class=\"how-to-section\">\n<h2 id=\"h_01K4VCPQZ8QERZKRC8D214HVFG\">Overview</h2>\n<p>There are two primary methods for managing distribution groups. The method you use will depend on your permissions and what you need to accomplish.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>Exchange Admin Center (Web)</strong>: Used by administrators to create new groups and have full control over all settings, owners, and members.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>Outlook Desktop App</strong>: Used by designated group \"Owners\" for quickly adding or removing members without needing admin access.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K4VCPQZ8GSBCK4VJ6RGEEC8C\">Prerequisites</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>For Admin Center management</strong>: You must have Microsoft 365 Administrator or Exchange Administrator permissions.</li>\n<li>\n<strong>For Outlook management</strong>: You must be assigned as an \"Owner\" of the distribution group.</li>\n</ul>\n</div><h2 id=\"h_01K4VCPQZ8P02JG5PYQ3Z31YFD\">Creating &amp; Managing Groups in the Exchange Admin Center</h2><p>Use this method for creating new groups or making comprehensive changes.</p><ol>\n<li>Navigate directly to the <strong>Groups</strong> section of the Exchange Admin Center by clicking this link: <a href=\"https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/?page=groups\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/?page=groups</a>.<br><img src=\"https://support.itsolver.net/hc/article_attachments/13742006253583\" width=\"1467\" height=\"597\">\n</li>\n<li>\n<strong>To Create a New Group:</strong><ul>\n<li>Click <strong>Add a group</strong> and select <strong>Distribution</strong> as the group type.</li>\n<li>Follow the setup wizard to configure the group name, description, and email address.</li>\n<li>On the <strong>Owners</strong> step, assign at least one owner. This is crucial, as it allows them to manage members from Outlook.</li>\n<li>Add initial members and finalise the settings.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>To Edit an Existing Group:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>From the groups list, click on the name of the distribution group you want to modify.</li>\n<li>A details panel will appear. Select the <strong>Members</strong> tab.</li>\n<li>Click <strong>View and manage members</strong> to add or remove users from the list.</li>\n<li>You can also manage owners and other settings from the relevant tabs here.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"note\"><strong>Note:</strong> Please allow up to 60 minutes for new groups or changes to membership to sync and become active across all Microsoft 365 services.</p>\n</li>\n</ol><h2 id=\"h_01K4VCPQZ8ETDA2DRD3XNP6JQ6\">Editing Group Membership in Outlook (for Group Owners)</h2><p>If you are an owner of a distribution group, you can use this quick method to manage members.</p><ol>\n<li>Open the Outlook desktop application.</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the <strong>Home</strong> ribbon, click on <strong>Address Book</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://support.itsolver.net/hc/article_attachments/13742032492559\" width=\"187\" height=\"157\"></p>\n</li>\n<li>Search for and double-click the distribution group you want to edit.</li>\n<li>In the properties window that appears, click the <strong>Modify Members...</strong> button<br><img style=\"aspect-ratio: 885/583; width: 89.69%;\" class=\"wysiwyg-image-resized wysiwyg-image\" src=\"https://support.itsolver.net/hc/article_attachments/13742047464847\" width=\"885\" height=\"583\">\n</li>\n<li>Use the <strong>Add...</strong> and <strong>Remove</strong> buttons to update the membership list, then click <strong>OK</strong> on all open windows to save the changes.</li>\n</ol><div class=\"additional-info\">\n<h2 id=\"h_01K4VCPQZ8F5GTW11CN8VHY6JZ\">Additional Information</h2>\n<ul><li>\n<strong>Distribution Group vs. Microsoft 365 Group:</strong> A Distribution Group is only for sending emails. A Microsoft 365 Group is a more powerful collaboration tool that includes a shared mailbox, calendar, SharePoint site, and Teams integration. Choose the right tool for your needs.</li></ul>\n</div><h2 id=\"h_01K4VCPQZ87F6X6P2DBP49ZW5M\">Was this helpful?</h2><p>If you've followed this guide, we'd love to hear about your experience.
