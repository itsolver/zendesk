  "body": "<p>\n  This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to configure a \"catch-all\"\n  mailbox in Microsoft 365. A catch-all mailbox receives all emails sent to non-existent\n  addresses at your domain, preventing them from bouncing back to the sender.\n</p>\n<div class=\"how-to-section\">\n  <h2 id=\"h_01K49Q9EZFS3PQP7MA2ZBY9C01\">Overview</h2>\n  <p>\n    Microsoft 365 does not have a simple \"catch-all\" checkbox. The correct configuration\n    requires a specific three-part setup to work reliably. First, we will change\n    the domain type to allow Exchange to accept emails for non-existent users.\n    Second, we will create a dynamic group of all valid recipients to use as\n    an exception. Finally, we will create a mail flow rule that redirects emails\n    for any address not in that group to our designated catch-all mailbox.\n  </p>\n  <h2 id=\"h_01K49Q9EZFWD8R62E1GFQT2WCM\">Prerequisites</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      Administrator access to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center and Exchange Admin\n      Center.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      A dedicated mailbox to receive the catch-all emails. A Shared Mailbox\n      is recommended as it does not require a license (e.g.,\n      <code>catch-all@yourdomain.com</code>).\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K49Q9EZFM2BX4S8M3NR063XQ\">How to Configure the Catch-All Mailbox</h2>\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 1: Set Your Domain Type to 'Internal Relay'</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This is the most critical step. It stops Exchange from immediately rejecting\n      emails sent to unknown addresses, allowing our mail flow rule to process\n      them instead.\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>\n        Navigate to the\n        <a href=\"https://admin.exchange.microsoft.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Exchange Admin Center (EAC)</a>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Go to <strong>Mail flow</strong>  <strong>Accepted domains</strong>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Click on the domain you wish to configure (e.g.,\n        <code>itsolver.net</code>).\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        In the details pane that opens, select the\n        <strong>Internal relay</strong> option.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Click <strong>Save</strong>. Repeat this for all domains needing\n        a catch-all.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n    <p class=\"note\">\n      If this step is skipped, the mail flow rule will fail, and senders will\n      receive a \"550 5.4.1 Recipient address rejected\" bounce-back error.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 2: Create a Dynamic Distribution Group for All Valid Recipients</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This group will automatically contain all valid mailboxes, ensuring that\n      legitimate emails are not redirected. This is better than manually listing\n      exceptions because it updates automatically as you add or remove users.\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>\n        In the EAC, go to <strong>Recipients</strong>  <strong>Groups</strong>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Click <strong>Add a group</strong> and select\n        <strong>Dynamic distribution</strong>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Name:</strong> Give it a descriptive name, like\n        <code>All Valid Recipients</code>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Users (Assign members):</strong> Select the option for\n        <strong>All recipient types</strong>. Do not add any further rules\n        or conditions.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <strong>Settings:</strong> Assign an email address for the group,\n        like <code>all-valid-recipients@yourdomain.com</code>.\n      </li>\n      <li>Complete the wizard to create the group.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 3: Create the Mail Flow Rule</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      This rule ties everything together. It identifies emails sent to non-existent\n      users and redirects them to your catch-all mailbox.\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>\n        In the EAC, go to <strong>Mail flow</strong>  <strong>Rules</strong>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Click <strong>+ Add a rule</strong> and then\n        <strong>Create a new rule</strong>.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Configure the rule as follows:\n        <ul>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Name:</strong> <code>Server-Side Catch-All Rule</code>\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Apply this rule if...</strong><br>\n            - The sender is located  <strong>Outside the organization</strong><br>\n            - AND<br>\n            - The recipient's domain is...  (Add all your domains that\n            need the catch-all).\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Do the following...</strong><br>\n            - Redirect the message to...  Select your catch-all mailbox\n            (e.g., <code>catch-all@yourdomain.com</code>).\n          </li>\n          <li>\n            <strong>Except if...</strong><br>\n            - The recipient...  is a member of this group  Select the\n            <code>All Valid Recipients</code> group you created in Step\n            2.\n          </li>\n        </ul>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Set the <strong>Priority</strong> to a high number (e.g., 10) to\n        ensure it runs after other rules.\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Click <strong>Next</strong> and then <strong>Finish</strong> to save\n        the rule. Ensure it is enabled.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      <strong>Step 4: Wait and Test</strong>\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Changes in Exchange Online, especially to accepted domains and mail flow\n      rules, can take time to propagate across all servers.\n    </p>\n    <ol type=\"a\">\n      <li>Wait for 30-90 minutes.</li>\n      <li>\n        From an external email account (like a personal Gmail or Outlook\n        account), send a test email to a completely random, non-existent\n        address at your domain (e.g.,\n        <code>random-test-xyz123@yourdomain.com</code>).\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        Check the designated catch-all mailbox. The test email should arrive\n        there.\n      </li>\n    </ol>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"additional-info\">\n  <h2 id=\"h_01K49Q9EZFCBKFMHN0E6KYJDJT\">Additional Information</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Increased Spam:</strong> Be aware that catch-all mailboxes are\n      magnets for spam, as they validate any address at your domain for spammers.\n      Ensure your spam filtering is robust.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Mailbox Size:</strong> Monitor the size of the catch-all mailbox\n      regularly, as it can grow very quickly.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      <strong>Propagation Time:</strong> Patience is key. If testing fails,\n      wait a bit longer before troubleshooting, as the changes may not have\n      fully taken effect yet.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"troubleshooting-tips\">\n  <h2 id=\"h_01K49Q9EZFMRCENGXH4XW38TKK\">Troubleshooting Tips</h2>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      If emails are still bouncing, double-check that all relevant domains\n      are set to <strong>Internal Relay</strong> in the \"Accepted domains\"\n      section. This is the most common point of failure.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      If emails are not being redirected, use the <strong>Message Trace</strong>\n      tool in the Exchange Admin Center. It allows you to track an email and\n      see exactly what happened to it, including which rules were (or were\n      not) applied.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01K49Q9EZFM5C6N0R4KZGQZZ6Q\">Was this helpful?</h2>\n<p>\n  If you've followed this guide, we'd love to hear about your experience.
